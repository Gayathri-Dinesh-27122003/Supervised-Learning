# Supervised-Learning

This repository is a comprehensive collection of various machine learning models implemented in Python. It encompasses both regression and classification algorithms, allowing you to explore and compare their effectiveness for different prediction tasks.

What's Included:

Regression Models:

Linear Regression: Implementations of simple, multiple, and polynomial linear regression to model continuous relationships between variables.
Non-Linear Regression: Code for Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression to handle non-linear relationships in regression problems.

Classification Models:

Logistic Regression: A powerful model for predicting binary class labels (yes/no or 0/1) based on a linear relationship with features.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies data points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Creates a hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes, with extensions like Kernel SVM for non-linear classification.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that predicts class membership based on Bayes' theorem and assuming independence between features.
Decision Tree: Learns a tree-like structure with decision rules at each node to classify data points into specific categories.
Random Forest: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved classification accuracy and reduced overfitting.
